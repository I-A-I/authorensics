An easily usable tool for anonymous author attribution, drawing sample texts from Facebook messaging. If you have an anonymous text and several candidate authors, *authorensics* uses one of two algorithms to calculate the most likely author.

Packages needed: flask, scipy, nltk (with "Punkt" and "Maxent" models installed)
